### Reason for repo
Obviously you can look at others submissions but most of them are in C++. This may make it hard beginners to translate C++ code to a more dynamic language like Python. This repo hopes to bridge that gap! 

### Update
I created this project on Friday, June 5, 2020. I am doing a minium of 4 questions a day so this project will continue to grow! ðŸ˜† Feel free to make a PR and with questions you have already solved in python3!!
